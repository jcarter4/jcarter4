- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Johnny
- I'm a psuedo-developer working on becoming a real boy

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in python mostly, while I have interest in javascript the language seems noisy to me. I have also dabbled in C++ and Java.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning flask, react and as always trying to deepen my understanding of algorithms and Big O.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on everything I can
